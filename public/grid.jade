        | Grid helps developers to build responsive layouts with less efforts providing column-based responsive blocks.
        | Conrnerstone implementation of the responsive grid system is very flexible and makes it simple to adjust grid to custom needs.
        | The number of columns could be changes in <code>_variables.less</code> file as well as gutter and grid breakpoint sizes.
        | By default grid consists of 12 columns which will stack into one column on mobile screen size (less than 720px) with 30px gutter.
